# Creating a Movie App in React

I made this app to learn the basics about React. Today I learned a little about JSX, Components, State, Hooks, Importing, Exporting, Await, Async, Fetch, Events, Dynamic Events, useEffect, useState, and much more.
 
This was my first exposure to a frontend library and I am surprised(pleasantly) about how powerful React is. I think I'll have to study more on ES6 for maximum comfortability using React.

Things I'd like to note: 
- JSX is very cool, I think I'd really enjoy writing in it.

- The syntax of React might get a little confusing for me to read if the developer is using many ternary conditional statements and not much spacing, so when reading React code that's something I should pay attention to.

- State seems like a concept that I should explore deeper, very useful (this goes for effects as well)


In summary, even though this project was a follow along I learned about the npm installer (I'd had some difficulties starting up my React and had to dive into some things), I learned how to start a React app and what is all included, I learned about React state and how to add state using Hooks, and I learned about JSX.

Things I'd like to explore further: React Docs, Hooks, State and what it is
